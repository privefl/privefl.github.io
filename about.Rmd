I'm fond of __Data Science__ and an __R(cpp)__ enthusiast.    
I'm the founder and former organizer of [the Grenoble R user group](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).    
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privefl) and [GitHub](https://github.com/privefl) as \@privefl and on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6103040/f-priv%c3%a9) as F. Privé.

### Current work

I am a postdoc in Aarhus, Denmark.

I'm interested in using statistical learning to advance precision medicine.
Specifically, I'm developing tools to analyse very large datasets and methods to build predictive models based on large genetic data.

### Hometown -- Education

I'm from [Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troyes), France. 
I naturally like Champagne.    

I was in prep school in [Dijon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijon).    
Then, in 2016, I graduated from [ENSIMAG](https://goo.gl/2aDwm1), an engineer school in __Informatics__ and __Applied Mathematics__ in [Grenoble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble). 

In 2019, I got a **PhD in predictive human genetics** in [BCM team](http://www-timc.imag.fr/rubrique44.html), Laboratoire TIMC-IMAG, Grenoble, France.
My supervisors were [Michael Blum](https://twitter.com/mblum_g) (TIMC-IMAG) and [Hugues Aschard](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/member/hugues-aschard/) (Institut Pasteur).
My thesis was funded by the [LabEx PERSYVAL-Lab](https://persyval-lab.org/en).
