### About me

I am fond of __Data Science__ and an __R(cpp)__ enthusiast.    
I am the founder and former organizer (2017--2019) of [the Grenoble R user group](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).    
You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/privefl.bsky.social) and [GitHub](https://github.com/privefl) as **\@privefl** and on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6103040/f-priv%c3%a9) as F. Privé.


### Current work

I had been an academic researcher for 9 years.

From August 2025, I am now a Data Scientist at [Aíma](https://aima-diagnostics.com/). I use machine learning and statistical tools to detect traces of (any) cancer in the DNA circulating in the blood.


### Hometown -- Education -- Research

I am from [Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troyes), France. 
I naturally like Champagne.    

I was in (Mathematics and Physics) preparatory school in [Dijon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijon).    
Then, in 2016, I graduated from [ENSIMAG](https://goo.gl/2aDwm1), an engineer school in __Informatics__ and __Applied Mathematics__ in [Grenoble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble). 

In September 2019, I got a **PhD in predictive human genetics** in team BCM, Laboratoire TIMC-IMAG, Grenoble, France.
My supervisors were [Michael Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-blum-83417b49/) (TIMC-IMAG) and [Hugues Aschard](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/member/hugues-aschard/) (Institut Pasteur).
My thesis was funded by the [LabEx PERSYVAL-Lab](https://persyval-lab.org/en).

I was interested in using statistical learning to advance precision medicine.
Specifically, I have been developing tools (e.g. R package {bigsnpr}) to analyze very large datasets and methods to build predictive models based on large genetic data.

From October 2019 to December 2021, I was a postdoc at Aarhus University in Denmark with [Bjarni Vilhjálmsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bjarni-vilhjalmsson-163a3810/), founded by the Danish National Research Foundation (Niels Bohr Professorship to John McGrath).

From January 2022 to August 2025, I was a Senior Researcher at Aarhus University, funded by a Lundbeck Foundation Fellowship (to Bjarni Vilhjálmsson).
I have been working fully remotely from France since December 2020.
