### About me

I am fond of __Data Science__ and an __R(cpp)__ enthusiast.    
I am the founder and former organizer of [the Grenoble R user group](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).    
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privefl) and [GitHub](https://github.com/privefl) as **\@privefl** and on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6103040/f-priv%c3%a9) as F. Privé.

### Current work

I am a postdoc at Aarhus University (Denmark) with [Bjarni Vilhjálmsson](https://twitter.com/bvilhjal). My work is founded by the Danish National Research Foundation (Niels Bohr Professorship to [John McGrath](https://twitter.com/John_J_McGrath)).
I will be working fully remotely from France from Dec 2020 to Sept 2021.

I am interested in using statistical learning to advance precision medicine.
Specifically, I am developing tools to analyze very large datasets and methods to build predictive models based on large genetic data.

### Hometown -- Education

I am from [Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troyes), France. 
I naturally like Champagne.    

I was in prep school in [Dijon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijon).    
Then, in 2016, I graduated from [ENSIMAG](https://goo.gl/2aDwm1), an engineer school in __Informatics__ and __Applied Mathematics__ in [Grenoble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble). 

In 2019, I got a **PhD in predictive human genetics** in [BCM team](http://www-timc.imag.fr/rubrique44.html), Laboratoire TIMC-IMAG, Grenoble, France.
My supervisors were [Michael Blum](https://twitter.com/mblum_g) (TIMC-IMAG) and [Hugues Aschard](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/member/hugues-aschard/) (Institut Pasteur).
My thesis was funded by the [LabEx PERSYVAL-Lab](https://persyval-lab.org/en).
