## Interests 

I'm fond of __Data Science__ and an __R(cpp)__ enthusiast.

## Hometown 

I'm from [Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troyes), France. 
I naturally like Champagne.

## Education

I was in prep school in [Dijon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijon).

Then, I graduated from [ENSIMAG](https://goo.gl/2aDwm1), an engineer school in __Informatics__ and __Applied Mathematics__ in [Grenoble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble). 

I did both my internships in Research, 

- the former on goodness-of-fit tests for the Weibull distribution with censored data (through Monte Carlo simulations),
- the latter in predictive human genetics, studying a massive dataset on [Celiac disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease).

## Current work

I am a PhD student in predictive human genetics.
I am currently working on making an R package for fast and memory-efficient
analysis on massive SNP arrays thanks to [package bigmemory](https://github.com/kaneplusplus/bigmemory).

I am also trying to contribute to R 

- by submitting my own packages to CRAN (or just [GitHub](https://github.com/privefl?tab=repositories)),
- by [contributing to other projects when I can](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Aprivefl+),
- by asking and answering questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6103040/f-privé),
- by posting on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
